The frontend implements comprehensive testing using:
* **Component Testing**: Verifies individual UI components render and behave correctly
* **Integration Testing**: Tests interactions between components and with the backend API
* **User Event Testing**: Simulates user interactions like clicks, form inputs, and navigation

Testing examples:

1. **Component Testing**
```javascript
it('renders checkout page initially', async () => {
  renderWithAuth(<Checkout />, { isAuthenticated: true, user: {} });
  
  const checkoutHeading = await screen.findByRole('heading', {
    name: /checkout/i,
  });
  expect(checkoutHeading).toBeTruthy();
});
```

2. **Integration Testing**
```javascript
it('loads authentication state from localStorage on initialization', async () => {
  // Set mock localStorage with auth data
  localStorageMock.getItem.mockReturnValue(JSON.stringify(mockAuthData));
  
  render(
    <AuthProvider>
      <TestComponent />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('auth-status')).toHaveTextContent('Authenticated');
  });
});
```

3. **User Event Testing**
```javascript
it('switches between payment methods correctly', async () => {
  // Test setup...
  await screen.findByText(/payment method/i);
  
  const paypalOption = screen.getByLabelText(/PayPal/i);
  fireEvent.click(paypalOption);
  
  expect(screen.getByText(/you will be redirected to paypal/i)).toBeTruthy();
  expect(screen.queryByLabelText(/card number/i)).toBeNull();
});
```

#### Test Coverage
To generate and view test coverage reports:
```bash
